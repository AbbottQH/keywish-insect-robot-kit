# Component List

# Introduction
In this project, you’ll create an Insect Robot that walks forward on four legs. Actually it's not really an
insect because it only has four legs, insects does have six legs, right? However, the robot got the name because
of its shape with the thin wire legs and the infrared sensor as eyes.We will briefly learn servo, arduino Nano and infrared sensor and build a body for the insect by binding,two servos together and shaping legs for it from a iron wire. Arduino will turn the two servos into one at a time,which moves each pair of metal legs like real legs so the insect can crawl forward. We will also strap battery on the body so our insect can move autonomously.Once you’ve learned the techniques in this chapter, you can easily extend your Insect Robot with new tentacles and sensors and new code.
